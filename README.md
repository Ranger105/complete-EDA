## Data Exploration
     1. Numerical and Categroical features.
     2. Null values filling of Numerical features.
     3. Normal Distribution of Target(Sales_Price) and some features.
     4. Set correlation threshold parameter and check for correlation with Target.
     5. Select only those having correlation above threshold.
     
     
## Data Wrangling
     1. Converting all Categorical data to Numerical (Encoding features).
     2. Dropping columns which are multi-collinear ( features having high correlation between eachother)
     3. Data having more non-linearity works best anyday.
